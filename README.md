# ToxicAntiCheat
It's an anticheat resource for the ESX framework running on FiveM.  I mean come on.  That's kind of obvious from the name, isn't it?

There is no support topic for this release on the FiveM forums.  If you need assistance, submit an issue here 

This resource spawns from a lot of previous works but primarily, the following two resources were vital in creating this and they should be thanked for their hard work:

**HG_AntiCheat:** https://forum.fivem.net/t/anticheat-for-fivem-stayfrosty-community/248835

**FiveM-BanSql:** https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-fivem-bansql/142487

This resource requires the ESX framework and it's dependencies.

**Install:** 
* Drop folder into your resources directory 
* add "start esx_anticheat" to your server.cfg
* add the sql file to your database and start your server.

**PLEASE NOTE: If you have installed the tables for FiveM-BanSql before, you can skip running the sql as it they are the same.**

**Configuration:**  The config file allows you to set the number of peds before the excess get deleted, whitelist steamIDs that don't get auto-whitelisted based on their group and set your blacklisted props, vehicles and weapons.

**What It Does:**  It will ban non-whitelisted users that superjump or sit in a blacklisted car the blacklisted car will also be deleted.  It will strip all weapons from a user that equips a blacklisted weapon. It will delete blacklisted props as they are spawned.  It will set a cap on peds in a player's area, preventing them from spawning numbers over your set threshold.

**Ban Controls:**  This is directly from the FiveM-BanSql page.  Currently, the ban system remains unchanged:
